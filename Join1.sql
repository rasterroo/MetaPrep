 BACKGROUND:
 
 The following schema is a subset of a relational database of a grocery store
 chain. This chain sells many products of different product classes to its
 customers across its different stores. It also conducts many different
 promotion campaigns.
 
 The relationship between the four tables we want to analyze is depicted below:
 
        # sales                                # products

 PROMPT
 -- The CMO is interested in understanding how the sales of different
 -- product families are affected by promotional campaigns.
 -- To do so, for each of the available product families,
 -- show the total number of units sold,
 -- as well as the ratio of units sold that had a valid promotion
 -- to units sold without a promotion,
 -- ordered by increasing order of total units sold.
 
 
 EXPECTED OUTPUT
 Note: Please use the column name(s) specified in the expected output in your solution.

 | product_family | total_units_sold | ratio_units_sold_with_promo_to_sold_without_promo|
